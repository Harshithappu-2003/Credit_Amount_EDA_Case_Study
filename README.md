# Credit Amount EDA Case Study

## Introduction
We have loan applications data for about 307k applications. The goal of this case study is to perform Risk Analytics with the help of data wrangling and visualization libraries in Python. The end goal is to derive important insights for the bank to identify characteristics of bad loan applications. (Bad loans are loans that are delayed or not paid.)

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on loan application data.
- Identify patterns and characteristics of bad loan applications.
- Utilize Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for analysis.
- Provide visual insights to aid risk assessment.

## Dataset
The dataset contains details of loan applications, including:
- Loan Amount
- Applicant Information
- Payment History
- Credit Score and More

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Credit-Amount-EDA.git
 ## 2. Install dependencies:
    Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## 3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    jupyter notebook Credit_Amount_EDA_Case_Study.ipynb

## Results & Insights:

### Key observations from the data:
- [Insert key observations here, e.g., trends in the dataset, missing values, correlations]

### Visualized trends in loan application success/failure:
- [Insert trends or graphs visualized in the notebook, such as success/failure rate over time, by region, etc.]

### Recommendations for reducing risk in loan approvals:
- [Insert actionable recommendations based on the analysis, such as adjusting credit scores, requiring additional documentation, etc.]
